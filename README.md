# Mathematics
All assignments, exams, and study guide(s) for math classes taken during the spring semester of my senior year at Wake Forest University, written in LaTeX.

I would like to thank Madison Hoff for her help with the Partial Differential Equations work. Much of the math you see here was a collaborative effort.

Finally, <b>WARNING</b>: not all of the math contained within this repository is correct; so, please use or be inspired by it at your own discretion.
